# Introduction

This app was conceived in order to refresh myself on the basics of React. The goal was to come up with an app sufficiently complicated and nested so as to force thoughtful organization of components and their state. I added persistence for the sake of realism. The Leaflet and Leaflet Draw libraries were used in their "standard" form (i.e. not the React-ized versions) as an additional exercise in incorporating non-react UI elements into a react app.

The contents of this repo are as follows:
- **designs:** UI concepts and component organization & naming
- **react-app:** The UI implementation in React
- **rest:** The REST application server for data persistence
