## REST Server

This was created as a quick and dirty server implementation to persist user map markers. The server itself simply writes JSON to files for each user. Future work would involve integrating with a proper database.

## How to run:

### 'npm install'

Installs npm dependencies

### 'node app.js'

Starts the rest server on port 8000
